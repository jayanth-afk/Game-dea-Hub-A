# Game Title
MULTI SURFERS


## Concept
3/4 Subway Surfers players start playing together online sometimes comepeting and deploying obstacles 
to hinder your competitors in 1 mode and collaboratingto make highscores together and swarm the
leaderboards.


## Gameplay
The player's objective in competative mode is make their competitors lose early by running faster and
deploying obstacles to hinder their path once the runner defeats the 2 other online runners he is given
a lot of extra score and other runners who are in the similar state as in (i.e. defeated 2 players) are
added to run with him. In Collaborative mode the 3 players run together to make high scores by helping 
eachother,if 1 falls/caught then if the other 2 manage to run enough to obtain the key he is released
again.The same if only 1 runner remains he holds the responsibility to free the other 2 runners if he 
falls aswell then the game ends.


## Unique Features
It is kind of like the already immensely popular game Subway Surfers but is more fun, entertaining and
has an exciting multiplayer modes available , in 1 they compete to find the best player among them
to top the leaderboards and in other they help collaborate as team to win together and reach the skys
of the leaderboards together.


## Target Audience
Anyone above the age of 3 can play it both the single player and multiplayer modes and it is targeting
friends to play together in their mean times, Any age groups of people enjoying playing together with 
people around the world to either socialise or make new friends or play with existing friends making
their bond stronger.


## Art Style & Theme
Almost Same as Subway Surfers and theme of different cities as maps encouraging players to play
at different country themes being fun and colourful showing their cultures while all having the same
leaderboards so that people can explore without worrying abt their ranking either in global/local frnds
FB rankings.


## Inspiration
I have always found the need of multiplayerin Subway Surfers.It has inspired this project


## Tools or Platforms (Optional)
I imagine this to be build for Windows,Mac, mobile devices and any other devices ,Using unreal engine
 having a very smooth gameplay, web version of this game will also be available, allowing crossplay 
 between all the platforms. People using any device can join this exciting world of Multi Surfers.
